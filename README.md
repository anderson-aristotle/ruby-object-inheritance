# Object Inheritence in Ruby

## Prerequisites

-   [ga-wdi-boston/ruby-object](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-object)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Diagram the Ruby method lookup chain
-   Write a class which inherits from another class.

## Preparation

1.  [Fork and clone](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Install dependencies with `bundle install`.
1. Create a `training` branch and checkout to it.

## Ruby Inheriterance

In Ruby, we have classes instead of prototypes. We attach methods to the class
since Ruby doesn't use prototypes. Ruby will be our first example of linking
different objects together in a hierarchy. This process is called "inheritance"
and the result is what we mean when we say an object "inherits" behavior from
another object.

Some objects can be classified in multiple ways. These multiple classifications
often make sense as a hierarchy. For example, a `Dog` is a kind of `Pet`. It's
also a kind of `Animal`. In Ruby, we can share code (data or behavior) between
two classes using **inheritance**. Let's look at an example of inheritance. Note
that a Ruby class can only inherit from one other class, so whether you name
that class `Pet` or `Animal` will depend on your application.

```ruby
class Animal
  def eat
    puts "Nom nom nom"
  end
end

class Dog < Animal
end

dog = Dog.new
dog.eat #=> "Nom nom nom"

class Dog < Animal
  def speak
    puts "WOOF"
  end

  def eat
    puts "Slop slop slop"
  end
end

dog.speak #=> "WOOF"
dog.eat #=> "Slop slop slop"

animal = Animal.new
animal.eat #=> "Nom nom nom"
animal.speak #=> NoMethodError
```

## Ruby: Super Inheritance

```ruby
class Animal
  def move
    "I can move"
  end
end

class Bird < Animal
  def move
    super + " by flying"
  end
end

puts Animal.new.move
puts Bird.new.move
```

This will print out:

```bash
I can move
I can move by flying
```

`Super` will call the same method defined in the `parent` or `superclass` and
give you the result.

## Demo: Drawing the Method Lookup Chain in Ruby and JavaScript

In Ruby, method lookup occurs through classes. In JavaScript, method lookup
occurs through inspecting the `.prototype` property on constructor functions.

Let's draw the method lookup chain, first through prototypes in JavaScript, and
then through classes in Ruby.

## Lab: Drawing the Method Lookup Chain in Ruby

Please diagram the method lookup chain using the following requirements:

-   The class `DenverBroncos` has an instance method called `lose`.
-   `DenverBroncos` inherits from the class `FootballTeam`.
-   The class `FootballTeam` has an instance method called `play_game`.
-   Diagram creating a new instance of the `DenverBroncos`: `broncos_2017 =
    DenverBroncos.new`.
-   Diagram how Ruby finds and executes the methods called on `broncos_2017`:
    `broncos_2017.lose` and `broncos_2017.play_game`.

## Lab: Model Shapes Using Classes

In a [previous
lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/ruby-object#lab-creating-a-shape-class),
you were asked to create and use a `Shape` class.

A `Rectangle` is a `Shape`, and a `Square` is a `Rectangle`.

Create a `Rectangle` in [`lib/rectangle.rb`](lib/rectangle.rb) that inherits
from `Shape`. You will need to override the constructor method inside `Rectangle` to take two sides of different lengths. Since all rectangles have four sides,
you can set a default value for `@num_sides` inside `Rectangle`'s constructor.

Test your code with `bin/rake test`.

Requirements for `Rectangle`s:

-   Rectangles should be instantiated with `Rectangle.new(3, 4)` to create a
    rectangle with a length of 3 and a width of 4.
-   Instances of Rectangle should respond to the `#calculate_area` method and give the correct result.
-   Do not override anything that doesn't need to be overriden.

Next, create a `Square` class in [`lib/square.rb`](lib/square.rb`) that inherits
from `Rectangle`.

Requirements for `Square`s:

-   Squares should be instantiated with `Square.new(4)` to create a square with
    all sides equal to 4.
-   Instances of Square should respond to the `#calculate_area` method and give the
    correct result.
-   Do not override anything that doesn't need to be overriden.
